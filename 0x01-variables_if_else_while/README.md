# C - Variables, if, else, while

In this project, I learned about using arithmetic, logical, relational, and boolean
operators in C. Additionally, I practiced declaring and defining variables of type
`char`, `int`, and `unsigned int`, using `if` and `if...else` statements, and
implementing `while` loops.

### Tasks.

* **Positive anything is better than negative nothing**
  * [0-positive_or_negative.c](./0-positive_or_negative.c): C program that prints whether
  a randomly generated number is positive or negative, followed by a new line:
    * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/0-positive_or_negative_c).
    * Stores a different random number every time the program is run.
    * Prints the number followed by `is positive` if the number is greater than 0, `is zero` if the number is zero, or `is negative` if the number is less than 0.

* **The last digit**
  * [1-last_digit.c](./1-last_digit.c): C program that prints the last digit of a
  randomly generated number, followed by a new line:
    * Completion of [this source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x01.c/blob/master/1-last_digit_c).
    * Stores a different value every time the program is run.
    * Prints the string `Last digit of` [number] `is` [last_digit] `and is` followed
    by `greater than 5` if the digit is greater than 5, `0` if the digit is 0, or
    `less than 6 and not 0` if the digit is less than 6 and not 0.

* **I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game**
  * [2-print_alphabet.c](./2-print_alphabet.c): C program that prints the alphabet in
  lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice.

* **When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off**
  * [3-print_alphabets.c](./3-print_alphabets.c): C program that prints the alphabet in
  lowercase, then in uppercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar`
  function exactly three times.

* **alphABET**
  * [4-print_alphabt.c](./4-print_alphabt.c): C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase
  except for the letters `q` and `e`, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar`
  function exactly twice.

* **Numbers**
  * [5-print_numbers.c](./5-print_numbers.c): C program that prints all single digit numbers
  of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.

* **Numberz**
  * [6-print_numberz.c](./6-print_numberz.c): C program that prints all single digit numbers
  of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function
  exactly twice without any variables of type `char`.

* **Smile in the mirror**
  * [7-print_tebahpla.c](./7-print_tebahpla.c): C program that prints the lowercase alphabet
  in reverse, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly twice.

* **Hexadecimal**
  * [8-print_base16.c](./8-print_base16.c): C program that prints all the numbers of base
  16 in lowercase, followed by a new line, using only the `putchar` function exactly three
  times.

* **Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success**
  * [9-print_comb.c](./9-print_comb.c): C program that prints all possible combinations of
  single-digit numbers, using only the `putchar` function exactly four times without any
  variables of type `char`:
    * Numbers are separated by `,`, followed by a space.
    * Numbers are printed in ascending order.
